# Codeception Coverage Patch

This patch is created to solve existing problem when generating codeception code coverage, especially for acceptance testing.

This had been reported [here](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/issues/845) as cookie failure bug.. so I put slight adjustment to make it work.
